BRIEF OVERVIEW/ FEATURES :
1. Infinite arena, but visible arena is 600x600, in 1st quadrant.
2. 


DEMO :

The demo makes the even numbered bots to move forward and the odd numbered ones move backward.

BUILDING THE DEMO :

1. Clone the repo. and cd into the cloned directory.
2. Run the following commands
   `make Start`
   `make Output`
   `g++ -std=c++11 -pthread Simulator.cpp -o Simulator`
   `make test`
3. Run the Simulator
   `./Simulator test`

TO USE IT IN YOUR ALGORITHM :

1. Place your algorithm file in the cloned directory.

2. Write these atop your cpp file:
   #include "Communications.h"
   #include "Motion.h"
   
3. Functions APIs as of now :
   a. forward(int BotID,int time_in_ms=10)
   b. backward(int BotID,int time_in_ms=10)
   c. right(int BotID,int time_in_ms=10)
   d. left(int BotID,int time_in_ms=10)

   The maximum time for any function call is 10ms.
